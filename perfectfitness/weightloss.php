<p>The majority of people who struggle with weight loss make 2 key mistakes; </p>

<strong>1.	Not eating enough or eating the wrong foods.</strong><br />
Many people believe that lowering food intake is the best way to lose weight. This may be true in the short term. However, lowered food intake slows metabolism and leaves with you no energy to exercise and burn excess weight! <br /><br />

Perfect Fitness analyses the diets of all our clients and provides advice, explanations and suggestions on how to improve their dietary intake without making massive changes to their favourite foods. <br /><br />

<strong>2.	Exercising too hard and then feeling exhausted.</strong><br />
Exercising really hard may burn off more calories, that is true. However, what really matters for weight loss is where the calories are coming from. Working at very high intensities &amp; pushing your body really hard is not effective for weight loss. It will teach your body to burn off sugar and not body fat. The result of training like this is to leave your workout feeling really exhausted, mentally tired and unable to do it again the next day because your tired and sore. You’ll never be able to achieve your long term weight loss goals this way. <br /><br />

<p>We focus on training your body to work at the right intensity to burn excess body fat during exercise as well as training your body’s energy systems to utilize body fat as a constant energy source so metabolizing fat better - even in your sleep. The most important part of our approach to weight loss training is that we educate you to be smart about your weight loss – it can be achieved with realistic, attainable exercise and eating patterns. It can even be fun!</p>
